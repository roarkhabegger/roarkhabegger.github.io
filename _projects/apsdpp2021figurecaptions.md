# APS DPP 2021 Annual Meeting

Below are figure captions for my poster, assuming I am not at the poster or available to explain the figures!

### Figure 1
This diagram illustrates the simulation setup. We use a hyperbolic tangent gravitational acceleration which changes direction at the midplane, $z=0$. The magnetic field is initially pointed in the $\hat{x}$ direction, and varies such that magnetic pressure decays exponentially with distance from the midplane.
