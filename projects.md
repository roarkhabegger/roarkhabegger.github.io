## Cosmic-Ray Feedback on Galactic Disk Stratification

Stellar feedback moderates the star formation and growth of lower luminosity galaxies. Cosmic-rays, high energy particles accelerated in supernovae explosions, contribute to this feedback. During my PhD, I have tried to shed light on how cosmic rays can influence the vertical stratification and structure of a galactic disk.

In my first paper of graduate school [(Roark Habegger et al 2023 ApJ 951 99)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/accf8e), I studied how the cosmic-rays from an individual star formation event can over-pressurize a magnetic flux tube. This over-pressurization makes the system unstable, driving an undular perturbation similar to the Parker instability. In fact, the modified Parker instability criterion has an impact on the end state of the flux tube - whether it rises indefinitely or eventually falls back to the disk.

More recently [(Roark Habegger and Ellen G. Zweibel 2025 ApJ 990 75)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adf4d7), I have worked on tallbox ISM simulations with many cosmic ray injections and supernovae events. Below is a video render from one of those simulations, where blue contours highlight cold gas $T<500\mathrm{K}$, red contours show hot gas $T\geq 5\times 10^4 \mathrm{K}$, green lines show magnetic field strength (darker green is stronger field), and orange contours enclose regions with high cosmic-ray pressure.

Hopefully, the importance of the distribution of cosmic-ray pressure is apparent. Cosmic-rays highlight magnetic flux tubes, making them more buoyant. Once these flux tubes rise and breakout to become vertical, the cosmic rays escape. This escape allows cosmic rays to accelerate and heat the thermal plasma, driving a large scale outflow. This outflow has a large mass loading factor since a minimal supernova injection rate was necessary to inflate the flux tubes.
