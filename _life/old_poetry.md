# Poetry Thesis

During my undergraduate years at UNC, I completed a creative writing minor in Poetry. This minor required I complete an honors thesis composed of original poetry. That thesis, titled ***Supercritcal Pitchfork*** is available on UNC's digital repository <https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/concern/honors_theses/sq87c092n>.
