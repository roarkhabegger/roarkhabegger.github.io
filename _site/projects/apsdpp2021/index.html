<p>Below are figure captions for my poster, assuming I am not at the poster or available to explain the figures!</p>

<h3 id="figure-1">Figure 1</h3>
<p>This diagram illustrates the simulation setup. We use a hyperbolic tangent gravitational acceleration (red arrows) which changes direction at the midplane, $z=0$. The magnetic field (blue arrow) is initially pointed in the $\hat{x}$ direction, and varies such that magnetic pressure decays exponentially with distance from the midplane and is a scalar multiple of the gas pressure. We inject cosmic rays from a Supernova slightly above the midplane (shown as a yellow circle).</p>

<h3 id="figure-2">Figure 2</h3>
<p>This plot is a cut of the simulation at $y=0$. We plot the gas pressure approximately 100 Myr after the injection. Plot 2a is from a simulation where the Alfven speed is greater than the sound speed, i.e. a strong field case. Plot 2b is a weak field case, where the Alfven speed is a third of the sound speed. This change in magnetic field strength affects the scale height of the gas and size of the simulation. It also means the cosmic ray streaming instability has less of an effect on the dynamics of the simulation. Note the strong field case produces a wider disturbance in the gas as a result of the streaming instability. Also, linear theory suggests the strong field case is “Parker unstable” whereas the weak field case is “Parker stable.”</p>

<h3 id="figure-3">Figure 3</h3>
<p>Directly analogous to Figure 2, these plots show a scalar dye which was initially placed on a magnetic flux tube threading the cosmic ray injection site. Now, the flux tube has lost mass (see Figure 5) and is floating upward from the disk. The color scale has been renormalized for these plots. Initially, the scalar dye had a value of $1$ along the flux tube. Plot 3a is a strong field simulation and Plot 3b is a weak field simulation (same as Figure 2).</p>

<h3 id="figure-4">Figure 4</h3>
<p>This plot is a cut of the simulation at $x=0$. This shows gas pressure, just like in Figure 2. This plot is from the strong field simulation, and shows how the injection of cosmic rays drive a flow similar to those in a Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The explosion of a supernova accelerates cosmic rays which clearly drive a transient change in the surrounding interstellar medium.</p>

<h3 id="figure-5">Figure 5</h3>
<p>This figure shows the mass on the initial flux tube (determined by a scalar dye) throughout a simulation. We show 4 simulations. The first two simulations are with a smaller cosmic ray injection (corresponding to $\frac{1}{10}$ of the energy a supernova deposits in cosmic rays). One is 2D (blue dashed line), and the other is 3D (orange dotted line). Comparing these simulations illustrates the importance of using 3D simulations. In a 2D simulation, a flux tube must lift all the mass above it. In a 3D simulation, the flux tubes above the de-loaded flux tube can roll out of the way, allowing the de-loaded flux tube to float up and lose more mass at a faster rate.
Additionally, we show 3D simulations for the strong (red line) and weak (green dot-dash line) magnetic field cases when the injection has the full strength expected from a supernova ($10\%$ of the supernova’s total energy). The weak magnetic field significantly delays the mass de-loading process.
Each of these curves results from an integration over a distance of $500 \, \mathrm{pc}$ along the flux tubes, centered on the position of the injection.</p>
