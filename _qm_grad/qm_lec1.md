In quantum mechanics, the mathematical formalism of vector spaces can simplify problems dramatically. The vector space most people are familiar with is $V^2(\mathbb{R})$. This vector space is a collection of all vectors in the Cartesian $xy$ plane. Both $x$ and $y$ can take any real value, so they are both in $\mathbb{R}$. Since there are 2 separate degrees of freedom $(x,y)$ each vector has 2 components. Hence the vector space is $V^2(\mathbb{R})$.
