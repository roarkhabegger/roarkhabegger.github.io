In quantum mechanics, the mathematical formalism of vector spaces can simplify problems dramatically. The vector space most people are familiar with is $V^2(\mathbb{R})$. This vector space is a collection of all vectors in the Cartesian $xy$ plane. Both $x$ and $y$ can take any real value, so they are both in $\mathbb{R}$. Since there are 2 separate degrees of freedom $(x,y)$ each vector has 2 components. Hence the vector space is $V^2(\mathbb{R})$. If you've ever dealt with complex numbers, you know we often visualize a complex  number using a Cartesian plane. A vector space where vectors are 1 dimensional and complex values $V^1(\mathbb{C})$ therefore has a one-to-one mapping with $V^2(\mathbb{R})$. For the vector $[x,y] \in V^2(\mathbb{R}) $, the corresponding vector in $V^1(\mathbb{C})$ is $[x+iy]$ where $i=\sqrt{-1}$.

Now that you have some examples, here are some formal definitions:

> A **Field** $F$ is a set of scalars which is closed under 2 operations, addition and multiplication.

> A **Vector Space** $V(F)$ is a set of vectors closed under 2 operations, vector addition and scalar multiplication. The components of each vector are scalars in the field $F$, and scalar multiplication only applies to scalars in $F$ as well.
