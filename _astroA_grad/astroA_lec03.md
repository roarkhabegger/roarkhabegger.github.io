Building off the last lecture when we talked about flux and luminosity through surfaces enclosing an object, we need to consider that space is not a vacuum. It is filled with atoms and molecules in various quantities.  The gas and plasma strewn throughout space will interact with any light and change what we see in the night sky. For example, consider how the Milky Way looks from Earth:

**Figure 1** This composite image shows the our view through the midplane of the Milky way. The observatory shown is the Blanco Telescope at the Cerro-Tololo Inter-American observatory in La Serena, Chile.

There are all these dark clouds! Why is that? There is dust and gas throughout the galaxy. Clouds of this material blocks our view of many stars. However, if we look in a different wavelength of light, we can see something else:

**Figure 2** This composite image shows the our view through the midplane of the Milky way in various wavelengths of light. Each wavelength of light interacts with gas in different ways, and some wavelengths don't interact with the gas at all.

To understand these observations and how light propagates through the interstellar medium, we need to model the interaction of light with gas. There are two types of processes: absorption and emission.
