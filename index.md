Hello! My name is Roark Habegger, I am currently a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Astronomy Department. I study stellar feedback by cosmic rays as well as multiphase, magnetized astrophysical turbulence across many scales (ISM,CGM,ICM). In general, I enjoy studying complex systems with computational models, distilling those systems down to their fundamental attributes, and constraining those models against observables.
